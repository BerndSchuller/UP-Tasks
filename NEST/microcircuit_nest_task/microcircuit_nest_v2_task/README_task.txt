This is the implementation modified from the original implementation to be able to run as task on Unified Portal. 
2.Version: Running simulation with input-argument defined in microcircuit.yaml, modify parameters in this file to change the simulation

Contributor:

Instructions:
    Running this task locally: 
        -> python microcircuit_nest_v2_task.py

    Output:
        -> folder Spinnacker will be created and store all output-results in format spikes_xy.dat and one file spiking_activity.png
